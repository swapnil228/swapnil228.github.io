            <p><strong>Principal Product Designer</strong> at TELUS Digital (previously playment, YC 2017 batch).</p>
            <br>

            <h4>Brief summary of my time at TELUS</h4>
            <p>
                From the last 3.5 years, I am leading the design of AI products for multiple product areas in our organization. 
                We recently designed SFT, RLHF and audio annotation tools for LLMs/Gen AI apps, and the project and workflow 
                management tools to support the annotation apps. Also, I have been working extensively on 3D and 2D data annotation 
                tools for AV and CV use-cases to train AI models.
            </p>
            <p>
                At present, I am leading the unification of UX of various products under the TELUS ecosystem and driving design 
                initiatives to create a centralised product for project and operations management for key accounts.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also carried out design hiring to help setup a team of designers for various pods in the organization and 
                mentored and provided design feedback to help them grow to lead their respective pods overtime. I have excellent 
                ability to provide critical design feedback that raises the quality of design and at the same time optimizes for 
                scope and developer productivity. Through data synthesis and insightful analysis, I bring clarity and structure 
                to the product development process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since getting into the AI industry, I have been continuously learning about how the technology works and its applications.
            </p>

            <h4>Ultra-brief summary of my UX career</h4>
            <p>
                I have a total of <strong>8+ years</strong> experience in the conception and design of digital products and as a UX 
                consultant for Enterprise products in AI tools, Healthcare, Corporate Travel, API marketplace, Business Intelligence, 
                Chat bot, Engineering Simulation software and more. I like working at the intersection of design, business and 
                technology. Love to work on challenging and complex problems with a motivated and talented team who is passionate 
                about delivering exceptional user and customer experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also a hobbyist coder. I learn React and Javascript in my free time. Have done a few course projects. I also 
                like storytelling and game development. Have done a few personal game projects on Unity and Godot.

            <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
            <p>
             To build Gen AI/LLM apps, we need to do fine tuning of models and apply reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to improve the quality of the output from the models and align to the defined policies. For doing these processes, we needed to design a set of tools that allow expert annotators to provide prompt response pairs, feedback and rating on the output from the models for various domain such as science, maths, and other subjects. We needed to design tools such that the annotators could consume instructions and use the utilities such as grammar check, plagiarism detection etc. to complete the tasks in a timely manner. 
             In order to execute the projects and manage the workflows, which are unique to each project, we needed to design a project management tool that allows the project managers to manage the client tasks and projects. The tool also needed to provide insights and analytics on the productivity of the annotators and the quality of the output from the models.

            <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
            <p>
              Data annotation tools are used to annotate or mark 2D and 3D data
              including images , videos and 3D point clouds. This data is used
              to train models for ML and AI related use-cases. A blend of
              creative thinking and logical analysis is often required to solve
              problems and design solutions. The design for these tools requires
              tool interaction design principles similar to the likes of tools
              like Blender and photoshop. As cost of annotation is directly
              related to man-hours of this business, design objectives are tied
              to improving annotator productivity and reducting the time to
              complete annotations.

            <p>
              SAP India Labs floated a project to redesign their API business
              hub to design agencies. As part of PeepalDesign, we designed a POC
              in 2 weeks to win the project. The API hub is a place developers,
              architects and business people search and discover APIs for
              various cases. The SAP system being so vast and containg thousands
              of APIs had made it difficult for users to discover and find APIs.
              As part of the design solutoin, we relooked at the architecture,
              search and navigation patterns and recommended concepts and
              solutions to optimise for search and discoverability of APIs and
              API solutions and personalisation of user groups.

            <p>
              TRAFORM, a startup in the corporate travel and expense management
              space, had built its tool which had a terrible UX and User
              interface. So they seeked out PeepalDesign to revamp and redesign
              their tool. It was a very complex problem as they were manageing
              multi-modal as well as multi city travel along with accommodation
              booking and expense management. The travel manager needs to plan a
              round trip covering multiple cities with flight, train, cab and
              hotel bookings and also ensure that all the expenses are logged
              and approved. There were several user groups for this tool: Travel
              Desk, Travel Vendor, Traveller, Invoice manager, Finance Manager,
              Billing etc., so the tool had to cater to the needs of all these
              users and at the same time provide ease of use and efficiency in
              completing the booking tasks.

            <p>
              Philips Diagnostic Imaging tool is used in the healthcare industry
              in hospitals and clinics to support their MRI machines. This tool
              is very complex and it required 7-8 designers who were
              responisible for different aspects and areas of the tool design.
              As part of this project on worked on revamping the UI and UX of
              workflow to setup Implant conditions of the MR software. Also, I
              worked on harmonization UI labels across modalities (MR, CT , DXR)
              and optimizing UI for patient registration.

            <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
            <p>
              The research team at Philips healthworks came up with the
              requirement of building a multi-modal chatbot for t oassist
              service personnels who go to field to service Philips healthcare
              machines in seeking service and device related information and
              instructions. Owing to various veritcals in Philips, the chatbot
              was needed to assist personnels in use-cases relating to various
              knowledge domains. As such a content authoring kit was needed
              which would enable the knowledge experts to create dialogue trees
              and deploy the chatbots for their respective use-cases. To create
              dialogue trees, data was fetched from a knowledge authoring kit
              which generated knowledge models to search and retrieve relevant
              data.

            <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
            <p>
              Having worked in the automobiles business for more than a decade,
              the CEO of Convergent Data Science solutions wanted to build a
              Business Intelligence tool for Sales Heads and Sales managers of
              Automobile dealerships to consume sales data sets, forecasting
              data and actionable insights for informed and intelligent decision
              making. We conducted workshops to understand requirements and
              ideated concepts and solutions to solve their problems. One big
              challenge was to fit large information sets into a single view
              which was visually balanced and grouped appropriately. Later, the
              concepts were modified and extended to create dashboards for
              several other user groups in the automobiles sales process.

              Racetrack.ai engaged with PeepalDesign to get design support for
              AI related products that they were building for their clients.
              They were building an app for Bharti AXA to assist insurance
              agents in searching for insurance product and customer information
              to help them with the sales process. We built a multi step
              conversational search and filter process to help them retrieve
              relevant information.
